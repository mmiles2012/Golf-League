# Manual Entry Tournament Implementation

## Summary

This implementation adds comprehensive support for manual tournament entry with the same style and functionality as the spreadsheet upload system, while ensuring these tournaments cannot be automatically recalculated.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`shared/schema.ts`)

- Added `isManualEntry` boolean field to tournaments table (defaults to false)
- Updated `insertTournamentSchema` to include the new field
- Modified `manualEntrySchema` to mark tournaments as manual entry by default

### 2. Database Migration (`add-manual-entry-field.ts`)

- Created migration script to add `isManualEntry` column to tournaments table
- All existing tournaments default to `false` (non-manual entry)

### 3. Backend Updates

#### Routes (`server/routes.ts`)

- Updated manual entry endpoint to mark tournaments with `isManualEntry: true`
- Updated other tournament creation endpoints to set `isManualEntry: false`
- Manual entry tournaments are now tracked separately

#### Recalculation Service (`server/recalculation-service.ts`)

- Modified to exclude manual entry tournaments from all recalculation operations
- Added logging when manual entry tournaments are skipped
- Updated all recalculation methods (tournament, player, all tournaments)

#### Migration Utils (`server/migration-utils.ts`)

- Added `shouldSkipTournament()` utility function
- Updated migration scripts to exclude manual entry tournaments
- Example implementation in `fix-all-hardcoded-points.ts`

### 4. Frontend Updates

#### New Enhanced Manual Entry Form (`ManualEntryFormNew.tsx`)

- Matches TournamentUploader style and functionality
- Features:
  - Individual player entry mode
  - Spreadsheet paste mode (tab/comma separated)
  - Tournament preview with summary statistics
  - Progress indicator during save
  - Warning modal before saving
  - Player search with auto-complete
  - New player creation dialog
  - Points preservation (no automatic calculation)

#### Updated Manual Entry Page (`ManualEntry.tsx`)

- Uses new enhanced form component
- Updated description to clarify manual entry behavior

#### Tournament Management (`TournamentManagement.tsx`)

- Added "Manual Entry" badge for manual entry tournaments
- Visual distinction in tournament list

#### Edit Tournament (`EditTournament.tsx`)

- Added Badge import
- Prevents editing of manual entry tournaments
- Shows read-only view with tournament details and results
- Displays clear message about manual entry limitations
- Properly handles player name resolution for display

## Key Features

### Warning Modal

- Alerts users that manual entry tournaments cannot be edited
- Explains that results will not be subject to recalculation
- Requires confirmation before saving

### Prevention of Recalculation

- Manual entry tournaments are excluded from:
  - Admin recalculation tools
  - Migration scripts
  - Automatic points recalculation
  - Tie handling updates

### Style Consistency

- Manual entry form matches TournamentUploader design
- Same progress indicators and status messages
- Consistent card layouts and button styles
- Preview functionality like spreadsheet upload

### Data Integrity

- Points and positions preserved exactly as entered
- No automatic tie handling or position adjustment
- Clear visual indicators for manual entry tournaments
- Read-only view prevents accidental changes

## Usage

### For Admins

1. Navigate to Manual Entry page
2. Fill in tournament details
3. Enter player results (individual or paste from spreadsheet)
4. Generate preview to review
5. Confirm with warning dialog
6. Results are saved and protected from recalculation

### For Tournament Management

- Manual entry tournaments show "Manual Entry" badge
- Cannot be edited after creation
- Display in read-only mode when accessed
- Excluded from bulk recalculation operations

## Database Migration

To apply the schema changes, run:

```bash
npx tsx add-manual-entry-field.ts
```

This adds the `isManualEntry` column to the tournaments table and marks all existing tournaments as non-manual entry.

## Benefits

1. **Data Protection**: Manual entry results cannot be accidentally modified by recalculation tools
2. **Flexibility**: Supports custom scoring systems and point structures
3. **User Experience**: Same familiar interface as spreadsheet upload
4. **Clear Communication**: Warning dialogs and visual indicators inform users of limitations
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear distinction between manual and calculated tournaments
